In the end, a 3\u201306 to 0\u201306 win brought the first title to Sheehy. By the 1959 championship, he was joined by his younger brothers Niall, Se\u00e1n \u00d3g, and Brian. Mitchels returned to the final for the first time since 1952, where they faced the North Kerry divisional team, Feale Rangers. His brother Niall saved the Tralee side with a late goal and earned a 1\u201309 to 2\u201306 draw. The following April, Mitchels won out on a 3\u201309 to 1-10 scoreline. This gave Paudie Sheehy his second county title. Mitchels were back in the final in 1960, and they again faced a divisional team, this time West Kerry. The sides ended level and a replay was needed for the second year in a row. Tralee won the replay on a scoreline of 1\u201311 to 0-03. It was his third medal, and he was team captain.\n\nQUESTION: The current football club of Harry Kane is?\n\nYour answer: [/INST]"
