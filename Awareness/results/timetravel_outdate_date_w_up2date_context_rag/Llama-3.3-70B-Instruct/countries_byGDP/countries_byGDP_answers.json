They were very seldom claimed or applied by contemporaries, because Wales, much like Ireland, usually did not have either the political unity or sovereignty of other contemporary European kingdoms such as England or Scotland. While many early rulers of areas within Wales used the title of \"King\", they were not, and did not claim to be, rulers of all Wales. Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain achieved wide circulation from 1136. It has little historical value, but it popularized a list of legendary kings of Britain that remains influential.

In the absence of the Prime Minister of Denmark, the Deputy Prime Minister takes over their functions, such as chairing the Cabinet of Denmark and participating in the Council of State. The title used to be an informal description sometimes used, especially by the press, for the minister who is second in the order of precedence. Traditionally, the minister of foreign affairs holds the second rank. It is only when the order of precedence deviates from this tradition, that number two is referred to as vicestatsminister. This happens in the unusual case when the leader of the second-largest coalition party is not minister of foreign affairs.

In the absence of the Prime Minister of Denmark, the Deputy Prime Minister takes over their functions, such as chairing the Cabinet of Denmark and participating in the Council of State. The title used to be an informal description sometimes used, especially by the press, for the minister who is second in the order of precedence. Traditionally, the minister of foreign affairs holds the second rank. It is only when the order of precedence deviates from this tradition, that number two is referred to as vicestatsminister. This happens in the unusual case when the leader of the second-largest coalition party is not minister of foreign affairs. In some cases the leader of the third-largest coalition party, who is as a matter of course third in precedence, has been called 2nd deputy prime minister ().
