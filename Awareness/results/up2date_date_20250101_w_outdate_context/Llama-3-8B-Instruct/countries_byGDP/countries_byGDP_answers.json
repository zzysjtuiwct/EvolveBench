Notably, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m played a significant role in Turkey's contemporary political scene. He took office as the Prime Minister of Turkey on May 24, 2016. As a seasoned politician and a key member of Turkey\u2019s ruling party at the time, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m's leadership period was marked by substantial political developments and reforms in the country. His tenure in office was critical during a time of considerable change in Turkey's governmental structure, as the country transitioned from a parliamentary to a presidential system, which consequently saw the abolition of the Prime Minister's role.
