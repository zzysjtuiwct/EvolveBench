There were 100 seats representing Ireland in this Parliament. This was the first United Kingdom general election, as the House of Commons of the 1st Parliament of the United was chosen from the members of the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland and not by a popular election. The 2nd United Kingdom Parliament was elected between 5 July and 28 August 1802, as at this period the exact date for the election in each constituency was fixed by the Returning Officer. The Parliament first assembled on 31 August for a maximum duration of seven years from that date.

In the absence of the Prime Minister of Denmark, the Deputy Prime Minister takes over their functions, such as chairing the Cabinet of Denmark and participating in the Council of State. The title used to be an informal description sometimes used, especially by the press, for the minister who is second in the order of precedence.

This happens in the unusual case when the leader of the second-largest coalition party is not minister of foreign affairs.

This election resulted in the re-election of An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva to a second term as President of Portugal. Turnout in this election was very low, where only 46.52% of the electorate cast their ballots. Cavaco Silva won by a landslide winning all 18 districts, both Autonomous regions of Azores and Madeira and 292 municipalities of a total of 308. Procedure Any Portuguese citizen over 35 years old has the opportunity to run for president. In order to do so it is necessary to gather between 7500 and 15000 signatures and submit them to the Portuguese Constitutional Court. According to the Portuguese Constitution, to be elected, a candidate needs a simple majority (50% + 1). If no candidate gets this majority there is a second round between the two most voted candidates.\n\nQUESTION: The head of state in Portugal is?\n\nYour answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
