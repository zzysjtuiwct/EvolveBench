In the absence of the Prime Minister of Denmark, the Deputy Prime Minister takes over their functions, such as chairing the Cabinet of Denmark and participating in the Council of State. The title used to be an informal description sometimes used, especially by the press, for the minister who is second in the order of precedence. Traditionally, the minister of foreign affairs holds the second rank. It is only when the order of precedence deviates from this tradition, that number two is referred to as vicestatsminister. This happens in the unusual case when the leader of the second-largest coalition party is not minister of foreign affairs. In some cases the leader of the third-largest coalition party, who is as a matter of course third in precedence, has been called 2nd deputy prime minister ().

His father Adam Norris is a retired pensions manager, and is one of Bristol's wealthiest people as well as the 501st-richest person in the country (as of 2018). His mother Cisca (n\u00e9e Wauman) is from the Flanders region of Belgium. He has three siblings - two younger sisters, and an older brother Oliver, who was also involved in karting on a competitive level until 2014. Norris holds both British and Belgian citizenship, and speaks a small amount of Flemish Dutch. In his early childhood, Norris tried horse riding, then quad biking and motorcycle riding before moving into karting after his father took him to watch the national British Karting Championships at age seven. Norris was educated at Millfield School in Street, Somerset. He left school without taking his GCSEs, but studied physics and mathematics with a full-time personal tutor. His family later moved to Glastonbury to allow him to become a day pupil, and to pursue his racing career, citing Valentino Rossi as an inspiration. At the start of his F1 career he initially resided in Woking near the McLaren team headquarters, but later moved to Monaco in 2022, for financial reasons.",
